## Overview



## Restructuring of Deep Neural Network Acoustic Models with Singular Value Decomposition

### Conclusion

The training data variability affects the capacity of DNN - keep more singular values.

the distributions of the singular values of each weight matrix are different - select different number of singular values for each layer.
